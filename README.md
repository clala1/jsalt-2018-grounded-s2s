# JSALT 2018 Grounded Sequence-to-Sequence Transducers Team

We are a team of computational linguistics researchers from academia ans industry that will be working together for six weeks during the [Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/) at John Hopkins University.

## What is the project about?

Video understanding is one of the hardest challenges in Artificial Intelligence research. If a machine can look at videos, and “understand” the events that are being shown, then machines could learn by themselves, perhaps even without supervision, simply by “watching” broadcast TV, Facebook, Youtube, or similar sites.

As a first step, we will combine written, spoken, and seen objects and actions in how-to videos: if we see a person slicing round, red objects and putting them on a brown surface, it is more likely that she or he is explaining how to make a sandwich than how to change a car tire. And we might learn that the red objects are called “tomatoe”. Our team will develop methods that exploit multimodality to process and analyze videos to accomplish three main tasks: speech captioning, video-to-text summarization and translation into a different language. These tasks are diverse but not unrelated. Therefore, we propose to model them using a multi-task (sequence-to-sequence?) learning framework where these (and other, auxiliary) tasks can benefit from shared representations.

The tasks we propose generate natural language, which has a number of well-known challenges, such as dealing with lexical, syntactic and semantic ambiguities, and referential resolution. Grounding language using other modalities, e.g. visual and audio information such as what we propose here, can help overcome these challenges. Information extracted from speech, audio and video will serve as rich context models for the various tasks we plan to address.
